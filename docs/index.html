Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) is a manufacturing process for producing thin-walled fiber reinforced polymer composites where dry fibers are placed inside a mould and resin is injected under pressure into the fibrous preform. In contrast to RTM, in Vaccum-Assisted Resin Infusion (VARI) vacuum pulls resin through the preform on a single-sided tool with vacuum bagging. During mold design for both RTM and VARI, filling simulations can study different manufacturing concepts (i.e. placement of inlet ports and vents) to guarantee complete filling of the part and avoid air entrapment where flow fronts converge.
